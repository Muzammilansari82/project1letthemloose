    <p style="text-align: center; color: white; font-size: 50px;"> Girls’ education and gender equality is very
        important for strengthening the society and lowering crime rates; but girl’s education today goes beyond just
        sending girls to school. It is also about ensuring girl’s safety while they are in school.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center; color: white; font-size: 50px;">Most of the parents in rural areas are now seem to be
        convinced in sending their girl child to school, but it is important that girls finish all necessary levels of
        education, learn extra skills and competencies for showcasing same level of competitiveness in the labour
        market. Education helps shape independent thinking of girls so as to enable them take decisions of their lives
        on their own and differentiate between right and wrong so that they are able to contribute towards societal
        development.
